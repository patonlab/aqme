verbose : True

# (1) CONFORMERS AND COM FILES GENERATION
CSEARCH : rdkit
QPREP : gaussian

# COMMON PARAMETERS TO EDIT
ewin_csearch : 1000 #energy window in kcal/mol to use conformers for RDKit and xTB (conformers with E higher than ewin will be discarded)
sample : 20 # number of conformers to sample to get non-torsional differences (default 100)

# (4.1) ONLY LOWEST ENERGY CONFORMERS REQUIRED"
lowest_only : True
lowest_n : False # for a given threshold of energy_threshold_for_gaussian
energy_threshold_for_gaussian : 100  # in kcal/mol, from all the conformers generated after xTB optimization
# lowest_n must be True to apply this energy threshold
