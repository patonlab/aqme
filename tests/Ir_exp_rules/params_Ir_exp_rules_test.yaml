# TYPE OF aqme JOBS
verbose : True

# (1) CONFORMERS AND COM FILES GENERATION
CSEARCH : rdkit
QPREP : gaussian

# COMMON PARAMETERS TO EDIT
ewin_csearch : 1000 #energy window in kcal/mol to use conformers for RDKit and xTB (conformers with E higher than ewin will be discarded)
sample : 10 # number of conformers to sample to get non-torsional differences (default 100)

# (4.2) DEFINITION OF A SECOND CATEGORY OF ATOMS SEPARATED IN GENECP
genecp_atoms : ['Ir'] # list of atoms included in the gen_ecp part
gen_atoms : [] # list of atoms inclueded in gen part

# (4.3) DEFINTION OF BASIS SET AND LEVEL OF THEORY AND SOLVENT
basis_set_genecp_atoms : ['LANL2DZ'] # functional for the genecp part
level_of_theory : ['wb97xd'] # functional

# (6) EXP RULES
exp_rules : ['Ir_bidentate_x3'] # apply some experimental rules to discard some outputs
angle_off : 30 # margin of error to determine angles (i.e. if angle_off is 30, and the angle is 180, angles from
# 150 to 210 degrees will be discarded)

# (7) OPTIONS FOR METALS, ATOMS WITH UNCOMMON HYBRIDIZATIONS AND NCI COMPLEXES
# IF A METAL OR AN ATOM WITH UNCOMMON HYBRIDIZATION (i.e. pentacoordinated phosphorus) IS USED
metal_complex : True # specify True to activate this option
metal : ['Ir'] # specify the metal(s) or atom(s) with uncommon hybridization, in the format 'A','B','C'...
m_oxi : [3] # oxidation number of the atom (it is used to calculate the charge of the molecule)
